Letters prioritises your privacy. Here’s how we keep your data secure:

- **Real-Time Transcription**: All audio is transcribed in real-time on our secure Sydney servers. No audio is permanently stored, and all audio is processed without leaving Australia.
- **LLM Processing**: Processing happens on Microsoft Azure servers in Sydney, ensuring no user data is used for training purposes or accessed externally.
- **Data Storage**: Documents are stored on Australian servers, encrypted at rest with 256-bit encryption. Documents are saved for 7 days by default, but you can adjust this between 24 hours to 28 days. After this period, documents are permanently deleted.

Patient consent is required before every consultation. We make it easy by providing a customisable consent form for your clinic.You can place in the reception of the clinic or in your room for patients to read and feel comfortable that their data is secure. 

Here’s an example script to obtain consent:
