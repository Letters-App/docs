<Accordion icon="shield" title="Privacy & Security Overview">
A brief overview of how we keep your information secure:
We perform all transcription in real time on our servers in Sydney, this means we immediately turn all audio into text during your consult and at no point in time permanently store your audio. By the time you have finished your consult we will have already transcribed every word and there will be no audio remanence from your conversation. We also never send any audio sent offshore nor is it accessible by a third party.
Following this, all Large Language Model (LLM) processing occurs on our Microsoft Azure servers located in Sydney Australia. No user data is ever utilised for training purposes nor is any information stored or accessed by Azure at any point in time.
Finally, all saved documents are stored on our Australian servers and encrypted at rest using 256 bit encryption. These documents are only saved for 7 days by default and then permanently deleted, this period can be reduced to 24h or extended to up to 28 days for your convenience.
For a more in depth overview of our security protocols please see our Data Privacy and Security page

<Accordion icon="person" title="Patient Consent">
  Patient consent is required for all consults with a patient, We make this easy by providing a customisable printout that explains how Lyrebird keeps patient information secure. You can place in the reception of the clinic or in your room for patients to read and feel comfortable that their data is secure.
An example script you could use to obtain this consent is "Please confirm that you are comfortable with us taking an audio recording of your consultation for the purposes of preparing a note of the consultation, which is then reviewed and finalised and stored for inclusion in your medical record."
Lyrebird needs to listen to you, so a good microphone is key. We suggest this microphone if you need to buy a new one.
