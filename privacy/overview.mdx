## Privacy and Security Overview

Letters is designed with privacy and security as the top priorities, ensuring full compliance with Australian regulations, including the **Australian Privacy Act 1988**. All sensitive information is processed and retained within Australian borders, never transferred offshore.

### Data Sovereignty and Handling

* **Data Sovereignty**: All health data is processed and stored within Australia, ensuring complete sovereignty and avoiding overseas data handling risks.

* **No Permanent Audio Storage**: All audio is transcribed in real-time on our secure Sydney servers. Audio files are hard-deleted immediately following processing, and all audio is processed without leaving Australia. Only the resulting transcript is stored.

### **Robust Encryption and Controlled Access**

* **256-bit Encryption**: We use bank-level encryption for all data in transit and at rest, hosted on our Australian Azure and Google Cloud infrastructure.

* **Controlled Access**: Access to stored information is tightly controlled under strict data processing agreements with Azure and Google Cloud, ensuring no third-party access to patient data, including Azure and Google themselves.

### **Localised Data Processing and AI Use**

* **LLM Processing**: All transcription and large language model (LLM) processing occurs on Microsoft Azure servers in Sydney. Our models are deployed in adherence to the Azure Data Residency Promise, ensuring no user data is stored or processed outside of Australia or used for training purposes.

### Medicolegal Assurance

Letters has been designed to meet the highest compliance and safety standards. This ensures Letters is safe to use in medical consultations, as long as appropriate patient consent is obtained.

* **Patient Consent**: Consent is required for all consultations. Letters prompts you to ask for consent before every session and stores the consent with a timestamp to provide protection against medicolegal risks.

* **Patient Consent Methods**: Over 99.5% of patients provide consent during their first consultation. In addition to verbal consent, practices can use a written consent form via their practice registration process.

### Data Retention and Custom Settings

By default, all audio and files you upload to Letters is deleted immediately following processing, with only the output being stored.&#x20;

* **You're in control**: Your data is in your control. Delete it at any time, in **Settings** > **Privacy** > **Wipe My Data**.

* **Customisable Privacy**: We provide an A4 Privacy Information printout for your clinic to help inform patients about how their data is safeguarded.

### Security Protocols and Legal Compliance

Letters adheres to the highest security standards in the industry.

* **TGA Compliance**: Letters is exempt from **Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)** regulations, but we maintain stringent standards to ensure safe, non-reliant clinical decision support.

### Enhanced Access Controls

* **Access Management**: Strict access controls are based on the principle of 'Least Privilege', ensuring that only authorised personnel have access to sensitive information.

* **Secure Billing Information**: We allow organisations to manage subscriptions and billing securely within the platform.
