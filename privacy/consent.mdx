## Patient Privacy is Crucial

At Letters, privacy and security are our top priorities. All sensitive information is processed and kept within Australia, never transferred overseas. Letters is fully compliant with the Australian Privacy Act 1988.

## Obtaining Patient Consent

Before each consult begins, we prompt you to request consent from the patient. By clicking **"Yes, begin"**, the time of consent is recorded, providing a timestamp to safeguard against medicolegal risks.

If you have further questions, consult with your insurance provider for legal advice on obtaining consent.

### How to Ask for Consent?

Here’s a sample statement:  
*"Do you mind if I use an intelligent note-taking tool in our consultation today?"*

> _Note: This is not legal advice._

## Patient Privacy Printout

To help inform patients about how Letters safeguards their data, we’ve created an A4 **Privacy Information Printout** for your clinic.

## Patient Consent Form

We’ve also created a **Written Consent Form** to help you obtain patient consent and explain how Letters secures their data.
