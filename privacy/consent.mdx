## Patient Privacy is Crucial

At Letters, privacy and security are our top priorities. All sensitive information is processed and stored within Australia, never transferred overseas. Letters is fully compliant with the Australian Privacy Act 1988.

Read more about how we manage patient privacy [here](/privacy/overview.mdx).

## Obtaining Patient Consent

Before each consultation begins, we prompt you to request consent from the patient. By clicking **"Yes, begin"**, the time of consent is recorded, providing a timestamp to safeguard against medicolegal risks.

If you have further questions, consult your insurance provider for legal advice on obtaining consent.

### How to Ask for Consent?

You could say something along the lines of, "Do you mind if I use a note-taking tool during our consultation today?"

*Note: This is not legal advice.*

## Patient Privacy Printout

To help inform patients about Letters, we have created a **Privacy Information Printout** for your clinic.
