## Intelligence Overview

Intelligence allows you to customise how your transcription is interpreted, summarised, and structured in the **Transcription Output Pane**.

### Intelligence Types

Choose how your transcript is structured using predefined intelligence types:

- **Notes**: A detailed clinical summary with structured headings (e.g. Presenting Complaint, History, Examination).
- **Patient Summary**: A simplified version of the notes, optimised for patient understanding.

### AI Suggestions

Based on the content of your transcript, the Assistant will generate real-time suggestions—such as **Disease Fact Sheets** or **Patient Action Plans**—to support clinical workflows.

### Custom Intelligence Types

You can create and save your own **Custom Type** to match your preferred documentation style. Simply give it a name (e.g. SOAP Notes) and provide formatting instructions. Saved types will be available across all future transcriptions.
