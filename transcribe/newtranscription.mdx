  <Step title="Intelligence">
    Intelligence allows you to customise how your transcription is interpreted and summarised. You can manage this from the **Intelligence** tab in the Transcription Output Pane.

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/viewintelligence.jpg)
    </Frame>
    You will be given the option to choose an **Intelligence Type**:

    - **Notes**: A detailed clinical summary with structured headings (e.g. Presenting Complaint, History, Examination).
    - **Patient Summary**: A simplified version of the notes, optimised for patient understanding.

    **AI Suggestions**\
    Based on the content of your transcript, the Assistant will generate real-time suggestions—such as **Disease Fact Sheets** or **Patient Action Plans**—to support clinical workflows.

    **Custom Intelligence Types**\
    You can also create your own **Custom Type** to match your preferred documentation style. Give it a name (e.g. SOAP Notes) and provide formatting instructions. Once saved, it becomes reusable across all future transcriptions.
